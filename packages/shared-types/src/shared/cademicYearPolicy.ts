/**
 * academicYearPolicy.ts
 *
 * Production-friendly academic year + cutoff policies by region.
 *
 * ⚠️ Reality check:
 * - Exact school-year start/end dates and age cutoffs vary by state, district, and school.
 * - This file provides sane DEFAULTS so you can:
 *   1) suggest grade from DOB (optional),
 *   2) label academic years consistently,
 *   3) run “rollover proposal” jobs safely.
 *
 * Recommended production pattern:
 * - Store an OrgAcademicPolicy override in DB per org (start month/day, rollover window, cutoff).
 * - Fall back to these defaults when org has no override.
